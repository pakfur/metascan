## Development

### Build Commands

The project includes a Makefile for common development tasks:

```bash
# Set up development environment
make setup

# Run the application
make run

# Run tests
make test

# Code quality checks (formatting and type checking)
make quality

# Install package in development mode
make install-dev
```

### Code Style

The project uses `black` for code formatting and `mypy` for type checking:

```bash
# Format code
black metascan/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy metascan/

# Run both (via Makefile)
make quality
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=metascan

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_prompt_tokenizer.py
```

## Architecture

### Process-Based Upscaling

The application uses a robust process-based architecture for upscaling operations:

- **Worker Processes**: Upscaling runs in isolated subprocess for stability
- **JSON Communication**: Inter-process communication via atomic JSON file operations
- **Queue Management**: Centralized queue with real-time status updates
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful cancellation via SIGTERM signals
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates with detailed status information

### Database Structure

Media metadata is stored in a SQLite database with the following key tables:

- **media**: Core media file information and metadata
- **prompts**: Tokenized prompt data for search indexing
- **models**: AI model information extracted from metadata
- **loras**: LoRA model references
- **tags**: User-defined and extracted tags
